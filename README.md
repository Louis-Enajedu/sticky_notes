# Sticky Notes Application

## Project Overview

The Sticky Notes application is a web-based project developed using the Django framework. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete notes, mimicking the functionality of physical sticky notes but in a digital format. The project demonstrates a comprehensive use of the Django web framework, including models, views, templates, and forms, alongside essential web development skills in Python, HTML, CSS, and database management.

## Project Goals
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provide an easy-to-use interface for managing notes.
- **CRUD Functionality:** Implement core Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for notes.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Build a scalable and maintainable web application structure using Django.
- **Documentation:** Ensure the project is well-documented for ease of setup and understanding.

## Key Features
1. **Create Notes:**
   - Users can create new notes by filling out a form.
   - The form captures the title and content of the note.

2. **View Notes:**
   - Users can view a list of all created notes.
   - Detailed view of individual notes is available.

3. **Update Notes:**
   - Users can edit existing notes through a form.
   - Updates are reflected immediately in the notes list.

4. **Delete Notes:**
   - Users can delete notes.
   - A confirmation prompt ensures that notes are not deleted accidentally.

5. **Responsive Design:**
   - The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a good user experience across different devices.

## Technical Stack
- **Django Framework:** The backbone of the application, providing the MVC architecture.
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for backend logic.
- **SQLite:** The database system used for storing notes.
- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **Git:** Version control system used to manage code changes and collaboration.

## Project Structure
- **models.py:** Defines the Note model with fields for title and content.
- **views.py:** Contains the logic for handling requests and returning responses for various CRUD operations.
- **forms.py:** Defines forms for creating and updating notes.
- **templates/notes:**
  - `note_list.html`: Template for displaying a list of notes.
  - `note_detail.html`: Template for displaying details of a single note.
  - `note_form.html`: Template for creating and updating notes.
  - `note_confirm_delete.html`: Template for confirming note deletion.
- **urls.py:** Configures URL routing for the application.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Louis-Enajedu/sticky_notes.git
   cd sticky_notes
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

5. **Access the Application:**
   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Unit Tests
- **test_models.py:** Tests for the Note model.
- **test_views.py:** Tests for view functions and template rendering.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Django Framework (MVC architecture)
- Python Programming
- HTML/CSS for front-end design
- CRUD operations
- Database management with SQLite
- Git for version control
- Unit testing
